# ChessModel

**AI model for chess**

This chess model uses positions from dataset of 2337 games with fide rating above 2000.
To evaluate these positions i used stockfish 15.1.

**If u want to use that model locally**
U need to install stockfish 15.1 from the official website: https://stockfishchess.org/download/
to the project inside the path from ``evaluation.py`` file to the ``stockfish.exe`` file
should look like that: ``./evaluation/stockfish_15.1_win_x64_avx2/stockfish-windows-2022-x86-64-avx2.exe``
